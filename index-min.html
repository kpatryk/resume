I am interested in AI, cloud, cybersecurity and DevOps, and I am driven to collaborate with open-minded individuals. My dedication to crafting cutting-edge technologies enables me to contribute meaningfully to any forward-looking team. </p></section><section><h2>WORK EXPERIENCE</h2><h3>Architect and Cloud Developer: Azure | Kubernetes | Python</h3><p class="company-paragraph"><a href="https://www.pg.com/">Procter & Gamble</a>| 2018 - present</p><p>I drive the adoption of software best practices and integrate DevSecOps and IaC principles in Network Automation team. I take an active role in building, architecting, and deploying Azure solutions while conducting Python development tasks, code reviews, and continuous refactoring. My unwavering dedication lies in optimizing performance and scalability, with a strong emphasis on maintaining a secure environment. </p><ul><li>Architect and implement backend REST APIs capable of managing DNS changes within the company through a self-service web portal, prioritizing security and performance optimizations using Redis. </li><li>Build integration with Elastic APM to send app logs and metrics from K8S clusters.</li><li>Develop a set of Python libraries to facilitate integration with external 3rd party APIs such as CA Spectrum, Cisco vManage, or to automate interactions with network devices (via SSH) for the IP Reclamation project. The built packages were created in a modular, composable way, so that they can be reused in other projects. </li><li>Setup Kubernetes test and production clusters, configuring Istio and enabling GitOps with Flux to enable continuous delivery practices. Ensure the smooth maintenance and lifecycle management of the clusters, patching, updates etc. guaranteeing a robust and reliable infrastructure for deployed applications. </li><li>Provide oversight, mentoring, and assistance to the NOC team's development projects, enabling the deployment of new applications on Kubernetes and help troubleshooting and solving encountered problems. </li><li>I am responsible for architecting, designing, and provisioning services for multiple Azure projects using Terraform. In addition, I play an active role in contributing to and maintaining Terraform modules across various projects, all in alignment with the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) paradigm. </li><li>Conduct a Proof of Concept (PoC) to explore the implementation and benefits of cutting-edge technologies, that can be used in our projects. One example is KEDA (Kubernetes Event Driven Architecture). KEDA is a framework designed to efficiently scale applications on Kubernetes (K8s). </li><li>Conduct regular code reviews of the team's efforts in various technologies, with a particular focus on Python. </li><li>Develop and implement an automation strategy that efficiently handles repetitive tasks across diverse projects. This strategy centers on a unified build and configuration process powered by a Makefile(s), leading to substantial improvements in the team's overall productivity. By adopting this approach, we can seamlessly automate a wide array of tasks, including but not limited to building Docker images, executing unit tests, deploying and running applications, retrieving logs from cloud services and numerous others. This unified approach streamlines development workflows, reduces manual intervention, and significantly accelerates the software development lifecycle by fostering consistency and standardization across projects. </li><li>Implement pre-commit hooks within our Python codebase to automate the validation, linting, code formatting, and resolution of common issues, while also proactively checking for security vulnerabilities. This initiative aims to enhance code quality, reduce errors, and promote consistent development practices throughout the team. </li><li>Promote Test-Driven Development (TDD) as the standard approach for all new projects. Encourage the adoption of powerful testing tools like pytest and advocate the implementation of mocks for effective testing. Highlight the numerous benefits of TDD, including enhanced test coverage, accelerated feedback loops, and heightened overall code reliability. By embracing TDD, we can establish a culture of quality-driven development that leads to more robust and maintainable software solutions. </li><li>To ensure a sustainable and maintainable codebase, prioritize the continuous removal of technical debt through refactoring. By proactively addressing design flaws and improving code clarity, we can optimize the maintainability and extendability of our projects, leading to increased developer productivity and reduced chances of defects and outages. </li><li>Initiate the integration of SonarQube into our development process to perform comprehensive scans, identifying code smells, potential security vulnerabilities, and other quality issues across existing projects. By implementing this, we aim to ensure the creation of a more robust and secure codebase. </li></ul><hr /><h3>Lead DevOps Engineer: PowerShell | Python | Jenkins | Java | IBM WebSphere</h3><p class="company-paragraph"><a href="https://www.dsv.com/">DSV</a>| 2016 - 2018</p><p>I have played a pivotal role in promoting best practices, standardization, and unification across teams, fostering a more open IT culture that encourages knowledge sharing and transparency.
