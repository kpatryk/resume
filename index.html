            and other services.
          </li>
          <li>Reduced and optimized Azure subscription costs by over <strong>50%</strong>, resulting in annual savings
            of <strong>$250,000</strong> after 1st year on Azure, through the implementation and tuning of dynamic
            autoscaling for both App Service environment and AKS clusters.
          </li>
          <li>
            Designed, developed and deployed a REST API backend for the DNS Self-Service project,
            enabling internal DNS management via a secure web portal. Implemented security and performance enhancements
            leveraging Redis. Initially deployed on <strong>Azure Web App</strong> and later migrated to <strong>Azure
              Kubernetes Service</strong> (AKS). This initiative resulted in a significant reduction of over 95% in the
            number of tickets related to DNS management handled by the NOC team, freeing up hundreds of work hours
            monthly for other tasks. It also empowered IT teams to manage DNS-related changes without needing to engage
